This game, upon running, starts on the paused screen, which shows the short list of user controls.

A summary of the controls are as follows:
[SPACE] Pause/Resume game
[UP]/[DOWN] Move the paddle up or down to hit the moving ball
[ESCAPE] Quit the game

The player paddle is on the right side of the screen, the automatic opponent paddle on the left.
The goal is to keep the ball from moving out the right side of the screen, but rather to hit it out the left side.
Once either you or your opponent have scored, the ball will immediately re-center to the middle of the screen.
